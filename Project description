PROJECT NAME- World Economic Indicator

Problem Statement:

The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development is creating a
department under its name which will focus on how a country can attain sustainable
growth. This organisation hires you as a data analyst for this department to
determine which factors a country should focus on to sustain GDP/ Capita.
Now, they provide you with the dataset ( World Economic Indicator Dataset), which
has different countries' and regions' GDPs, populations, and other factors that might
impact GDP/Capita. Now using Data Analysis methods, develop a solution that can
be referred to as “how a country can attain sustainable growth“.

Steps what I Follow:
Formating & Data ProcessingBefore i start with my analysis, rearrange the columns in all sheets where i
can bring all the common columns as the first three columns of the individual sheet.
Then perform formatting on each sheet to make it presentable and understandable.
Once my sheet is ready,I Apply data processing steps to prepare the dataset for the
analysis.
Data AnalysisFind individual features and study their distribution in the dataset. Further, analyse
how they impact the GDP column (like how Lending Interest affects GDP ) and
develop factors that affect a country's GDP to solve our Business Problem.
StorytellingCreate a storyline that can be presented to the stakeholders. This should have all the
insight you got while doing the analysis.
